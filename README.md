## Pig Dice Game
When its your turn, roll the dice.
You can see the score for each roll you make, the cumulative score is also visible for each player
The first player to score 100 points wins the game
       
## Project technologies
The game uses
Html
Css
Javascript (including constructors and prototypes)

## Future projections
For future adjustments I would like to present an option where the game allows us to select the number of players participating and store scores according to usernames.
